## Known Production Issues (from Team)

### From Alex (Tech Lead):
"Here are the main issues we've documented:
1. **Date Format Chaos**: We've seen at least 5 different date formats. Some European customers use DD/MM/YYYY which breaks everything
2. **State Code Issues**: Sometimes lowercase, sometimes full state names ('California' instead of 'CA')
3. **Memory Issues**: Script crashes on files > 10MB (about 50k rows)
4. **Special Characters**: UTF-8 issues with international customer names break PDF generation
5. **Network Share**: If the mount is down, script just hangs forever
6. **Tax Calculation**: Q4 tax adjustment was hardcoded, finance wants it configurable"

### From Sarah (DevOps):
"Additional context:
- The EC2 instance runs Ubuntu 16.04 (EOL)
- Python 2.7 (also EOL) 
- ReportLab version 2.5 (from 2010!)
- No monitoring, we only know it failed when finance complains
- Cron runs it every 2 hours: `0 */2 * * * /usr/bin/python2.7 /opt/invoice_processor/process_invoices.py`
- Takes 45 mins for 1000 invoices on a good day"

## Business Rules Summary (from Finance Team via Alex)

### Tax Rules:
1. Base tax by state (see STATE_TAX_RATES in script)
2. Some customers have negotiated rates (CUSTOMER_TAX_OVERRIDES)
3. Q4 gets 2% additional tax (Oct-Dec) - year-end accounting rule
4. Tax exempt customers (nonprofits) should have 0% tax
5. Bulk orders (>$10k) get 3% discount BEFORE tax calculation

### Late Fees:
1. Applied after 30 days past due
2. 1.5% per month (not compounded despite code comment)
3. Should cap at 18% total (not implemented)

### Invoice Rules:
1. Minimum invoice amount: $25
2. Invoice filename format: CUSTOMERID_DATE_TOTAL.pdf
3. All amounts rounded to 2 decimal places

### Edge Cases We've Seen:
- Negative amounts (credits) - script crashes
- $0 invoices - should skip but doesn't
- Same customer, same day, multiple invoices - overwrites PDF
- Items field sometimes has commas in item names - breaks parsing
- Some customers put quantity as decimal (1.5 hours) - works accidentally
