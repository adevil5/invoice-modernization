**Technology Stack**:
- Python 2.7 (EOL January 1, 2020)
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (EOL April 2021)
- ReportLab 2.5 for PDF generation
- Network file shares for input/output
- Cron job scheduling (every 2 hours)

**Performance Metrics**:
- Processing rate: ~22 invoices per minute
- 1,000 invoices take approximately 45 minutes
- Memory limit: Files over 10MB cause OutOfMemoryError

## Business Rules - Documented

### Tax Calculation Rules

#### 1. Tax Rate Priority Order
1. **Customer-specific overrides** (highest priority)
2. **State-based rates**
3. **Default rate** (lowest priority)

#### 2. Customer Tax Overrides
| Customer ID | Tax Rate | Reason |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| CUST001 | 0% | Registered nonprofit organization |

#### 3. State Tax Rates
| State | Rate | State | Rate |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| CA | 7.25% | NV | 6.85% |
| NY | 8.00% | WA | 6.50% |
| TX | 6.25% | FL | 6.00% |
| IL | 6.25% | OH | 5.75% |
| PA | 6.00% | AZ | 5.60% |
| Default (unknown states) | 5.00% | - | - |

#### 4. Q4 Tax Adjustment
- **Period**: October 1 - December 31
- **Additional tax**: 2% (added to base rate, not multiplied)
- **Example**: CA rate becomes 9.25% (7.25% + 2%), not 7.395%

#### 5. Bulk Discount
- **Threshold**: Orders ≥ $10,000.00 (inclusive)
- **Discount**: 3% of subtotal
- **Application**: Applied BEFORE tax calculation
- **Formula**: Tax = (Subtotal - Discount) × Tax Rate

### Late Fee Rules

#### 1. Late Fee Trigger
- Applied after 30 days past due date
- Any partial day counts as a full month

#### 2. Late Fee Calculation
- **Rate**: 1.5% per month
- **Method**: Simple interest (not compound)
- **Base**: Calculated on total invoice amount (including tax)
- **Formula**: Late Fee = Invoice Total × 1.5% × Number of Months
- **Note**: 18% cap mentioned in comments but NOT implemented

### Invoice Processing Rules

#### 1. Minimum Invoice Amount
- **Minimum**: $25.00
- **Behavior**: Amounts < $25 are silently adjusted to $25 (no error raised)

#### 2. Rounding
- All monetary values rounded to 2 decimal places
- Uses "round half up" method
- Each intermediate calculation is rounded before next operation

#### 3. PDF Generation
- **Filename format**: `{CUSTOMER_ID}_{INVOICE_DATE}_{TOTAL}.pdf`
- **Date format in filename**: Always YYYY-MM-DD regardless of input format
- **Company name**: Hardcoded as "ACME Corp Invoice"
- **Duplicate handling**: Same customer + date overwrites existing PDF (data loss risk)

## Business Rules - Discovered

### Tax Calculation Edge Cases

#### 1. State Name Variations
The system accepts multiple formats for state identification:
- **Uppercase codes**: CA, NY, TX (standard)
- **Lowercase codes**: ca, ny, tx (converted to uppercase)
- **Full state names**: California, New York, Texas (mapped to codes)
- **Unknown formats**: Default to 5% tax rate

#### 2. Tax Override Implementation
- Customer overrides take absolute precedence
- Q4 adjustment is ignored for tax-exempt customers
- No validation that override rates are reasonable (could be > 100%)

### Data Validation Gaps

#### 1. Missing Validations
- **Negative amounts**: Processed without validation (causes crashes)
- **Zero invoices**: Processed and PDFs generated (should be rejected)
- **Duplicate detection**: None (same invoice can be processed multiple times)
- **Customer ID**: Empty customer IDs cause row to be skipped silently

#### 2. Amount Parsing Behavior
- Strips whitespace from amounts
- Accepts leading/trailing decimals (.50, 100.)
- No comma handling (1,234.56 causes error)
- No currency symbol handling ($100 causes error)

### CSV Processing Details

#### 1. Format Detection
- Attempts comma delimiter first
- Falls back to semicolon if comma parsing fails
- No support for other delimiters (tab, pipe)

#### 2. Encoding Handling
- Primary: UTF-8
- Fallback: ISO-8859-1 if UTF-8 fails
- UTF-16/32 files cause complete failure

#### 3. Column Requirements
Expected columns in order:
1. customer_id
2. customer_name
3. address
4. city
5. state
6. zip
7. amount
8. invoice_date
9. due_date
10. items

Missing columns cause "list index out of range" error.

### Date Handling Specifics

#### 1. Supported Date Formats (in parsing order)
1. MM/DD/YYYY (01/15/2024)
2. YYYY-MM-DD (2024-01-15)
3. MM-DD-YYYY (01-15-2024)
4. M/D/YY (1/5/24) - discovered through testing

#### 2. Unsupported Formats (cause silent failures)
- DD/MM/YYYY (European format)
- Text formats (Jan 15, 2024)
- Dot notation (15.01.2024)

#### 3. Date Math Issues
- February 31st and similar invalid dates cause crashes
- No leap year handling in date calculations
- Month boundary calculations can fail

### Items Field Parsing

#### 1. Format Specification
- **Format**: `item:quantity:price|item:quantity:price`
- **Delimiters**: Pipe (|) between items, colon (:) within items
- **Empty handling**: Empty items field treated as "Unspecified:1:0"

#### 2. Edge Cases
- Decimal quantities work accidentally (1.5 hours)
- Commas in item names break parsing
- Missing price/quantity sections cause silent skip
- No validation of numeric values in quantity/price

### Performance Characteristics

#### 1. Memory Usage
- Entire CSV file loaded into memory
- 10MB threshold before OutOfMemoryError
- No streaming or batch processing
- Memory not released between files

#### 2. Processing Bottlenecks
- PDF generation: ~2.7 seconds per invoice
- No parallel processing
- Sequential file processing
- Network share latency adds 0.5-1 second per file

#### 3. Failure Modes
- Network share unavailable: Script hangs indefinitely
- Disk full: Crashes without cleanup
- Memory exhaustion: Kills Python process
- Any error: No recovery, manual restart required

## Technical Specifications

### File System Paths
- **Input**: `/mnt/finance_share/invoices/pending/`
- **Output**: `/mnt/finance_share/invoices/processed/`
- **Archive**: `/mnt/finance_share/invoices/archive/YYYY/MM/`
- **Logs**: `/var/log/invoice_processor.log` (often fails silently)

### Error Handling
- Most errors logged to file (when writable)
- Many operations have bare except clauses
- No error notifications or alerts
- Failed files left in pending directory

### Security Concerns
- Runs as root user (unnecessary privilege)
- No input sanitization (potential for injection)
- Network shares mounted with full permissions
- No audit trail of who processed what

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Critical Issues
1. **No Late Fee Cap**: 18% maximum mentioned but not implemented
2. **PDF Overwrites**: Same customer + date = data loss
3. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large files crash system
4. **Silent Failures**: Many errors not logged or reported
5. **No Duplicate Detection**: Same invoice processed multiple times

### Operational Issues

## Summary

The legacy system has served its purpose but has accumulated significant technical debt and limitations. The discovered behaviors and undocumented rules represent both risks and requirements for the modernization effort. Key priorities should be:

1. **Maintain exact business logic parity** for tax and fee calculations
2. **Fix critical bugs** (late fee cap, PDF overwrites)
3. **Improve reliability** through better error handling
4. **Enhance performance** through modern architecture
5. **Add flexibility** for future business rule changes

The modernization should treat all discovered behaviors as requirements unless explicitly identified as bugs to be fixed. This ensures backward compatibility while improving the system's reliability and maintainability.
